# Bytebeats
In this repo, you will find various bytebeats that i made. I made all of these formulas in Dollchan Bytebeat Composer.
If i don't mention any specific frequency in some bytebeat formulas, then just use 8000Hz.

# Variants
Variants are just bytebeat formulas based on the original (Variant 1) formula. Variants have nothing to do with sound similarity, it's all about the formulas.
